FedOps (`fedops`) is a platform that helps organizations effectively manage and coordinate their federated learning operations:

* **FLScalize**: It simplifies the application of data and models in a FL environment by leveraging Flower's Client and Server.

* **Manager**: The manager oversees and manages the real-time FL progress of both clients and server

* **CE/CS & BCFL**: Contribution Evaluation and Client Selection processes incentivize individual clients through a BCFL function based on their performance.


* **CI/CD/CFL**: the CI/CD/CFL system seamlessly integrates with a Code Repo, 
enabling code deployment to multiple clients and servers for continuous or periodic federated learning.


* **Monitoring**: The FL dashboard is available for monitoring and observing the lifecycle of FL clients and server
